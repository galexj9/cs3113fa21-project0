Garrett Alexander

How to Use
- from the command line run 'make' to build the project
- Run project0 with a chosen file directed to stdin
- ex: ./project0 < readFile > readOut
- ex: cat test1 | project0

Requirements and Limitations
- This program is designed to run exclusively on valid, US-English, UTF-8 files.
- Running non-valid files results in fgetwc() throwing silent invalid char errors.
- The sort() function runs in O(1) space but O(n^2) time where n = # of unique chars.
